<p>Hi, I’m Victoria, an experienced Celebrity Assistant turned Full Stack Web Developer!</p>
<p>My journey in life has blessed me with many adventures beginning as a celebrity executive assistant
  that encompassed web/database administration to full life cycle project management for an elite NBA All-Star
  athlete, and his beautiful 5-time Grammy nominated wife. My career continued with the opportunity to manage
  the busy and chaotic life/work schedule of a world-renowned classical violinist from Chicago. I've had the pleasure
  of living in London and Europe.  And, continued travel to teach English, in a foreign land-to young
  school age children-think Dothraki-a land far, far away.</p>

<p>I love and welcome the opportunity to seek and fulfill my wanderlust for travel. While life has brought me a
  great number of experiences on a global scale, as well as work opportunities, I have also
  experienced sadness and great loss in the passing of both parents, within a short, one year’s time. This brings
  me to this new space of taking the leap and allow myself to blossom as a full stack web developer. A path of
  combining and blending my past work experiences and talents to building my skills with continued growth. </p>

  <p>I exude a grounding presence that combines calmness, strength and a genuine love for life.</p>

  <p>I am thrilled that you had the time and interest in taking a quick look at my website. Whether I am coding
    or assembling a team for a new project, or putting a band on stage. I am passionate about bringing my unique
    set of skills together for the user and any fans, live experience. </p>
  <br>
  <p>With gratitude and love,</p>
